This project contains the R source code of the Self-Interpolation Method (SIM).

This algorithm builds a Digital Terrain Model (DTM) from a Digital Surface Model (DSM) given as input.

The method is described and evaluated in the paper:
L.R. Emmendorfer, I.B. Emmendorfer, L.P.M. de Almeida, D.C.L. Alves and J.A. Neto. A Self-Interpolation Method for Digital Terrain Model Generation (submitted), 2021.
